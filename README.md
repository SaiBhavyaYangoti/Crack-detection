# Crack-detection
This project focuses on detecting cracks in buildings and infrastructure using Deep Learning. The system is built using DeepLabV3, which identifies cracks in images, highlights them with bounding boxes, and generates segmentation masks. Additionally, it estimates the severity of the cracks by measuring their width using an Excel sheet-based method. The dataset consists of images and corresponding masks, allowing the model to learn and accurately detect various crack patterns.

The model was trained and evaluated using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy, achieving high accuracy in detecting cracks. This system can be used in real-world applications for automated structural monitoring and maintenance planning. The repository includes the trained model, dataset, and scripts for running inference on new images.
